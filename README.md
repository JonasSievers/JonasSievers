### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Ph.D. student at the Karlsruhe Institut of Technology (KIT) affiliated with the Institute for Data Processing and Electronics (IPE), with a primary focus on machine learning applications in energy systems. Throughout my research I explore different machine learning techniques, including federated learning, reinforcement learning, and time series forecasting, as they are increasingly important in the optimization of energy management systems.

Federated learning enables collaborative model training without sharing sensitive data, allowing various energy devices and sources to work together to enhance system efficiency while preserving privacy and security. This decentralization of decision-making can lead to more effective resource allocation and energy consumption optimization.

Reinforcement learning, on the other hand, empowers energy management systems to make dynamic decisions by learning from interactions with the environment. This adaptability results in more responsive control strategies that can optimize energy consumption, reduce waste, and lower operational costs.

Time series forecasting, driven by machine learning algorithms, utilizes historical energy data to make accurate predictions, helping energy managers plan and allocate resources more efficiently. This leads to a reduction in energy wastage and an improvement in grid stability.

I usally provide all source code required to reproduce research and build upon it. If you have any questions or stumble over any problem, feel free to reach out to me or open an issue on Github.
